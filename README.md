# PRISM Configuration Validator
## 📖 Overview
The **PRISM Configuration Validator** is a comprehensive Streamlit web application designed to automate and streamline the process of validating Microsoft SQL Server-based PRISM configurations. It compares live database data against reference technical design templates (TDTs), providing detailed summaries and mismatch reports across various configuration sections.

The application features a modular architecture, allowing for easy extension and maintenance of different validation types.<br>

## ✨ Key Features
*   **Modular Validation Tabs:** Each validation type is organized into its own dedicated tab for a clean user experience.
    *   Consolidation Overview
    *   Metric Validation (Template)
    *   Metric Mapping Validation (Project)
    *   Filter Validation (Project)
    *   Failure Diagnostics Validation (Template)
    *   Absolute Deviation Validation
*   **Dynamic File Generation:** Automatically consolidates multiple TDT Excel files from a selected local folder into the required reference files, eliminating manual preparation.
*   **Secure Database Connection:** Uses Streamlit's secrets management to handle database credentials securely.
*   **Dynamic SQL Queries:** Fetches model deployment configurations based on user-provided asset lists.
*   **Interactive Reports:** Presents validation results in clear, filterable tables, including summaries, matches, and categorized mismatches.
*   **Optional File Downloads:** Allows users to download the consolidated reference files for offline analysis.<br>

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the PRISM Validator on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
  * **Python:** Version 3.9 or higher.
  * **uv:** The fast Python package installer. If you don't have it, install it with:
    ```
    pip install uv
    ```
  * **Git:** For cloning the repository.
  * **Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server:** This is a critical system-level requirement. The application cannot connect to the database without it. Download and install it from the official Microsoft website.

### 2. Setup Instructions

**Step 1: Download the Code**
  1. Navigate to the GitHub repository page `https://github.com/gred-adi/prism-validator/`
  2. Click the green `< > Code` button.
  3. Click **"Download ZIP"**.
  4. Find the downloaded ZIP file on your computer and **unzip it**.

**Step 2: Create Home Directory**
  1. Navigate to your **Documents** folder.
  2. Transfer the unzipped folder called `prism-validator`.

**Step 3: Initialize the Development Environment**
  
  Prerequisites: You'll need uv and VS Code installed before you can initialize the development environment.
  1. Open **VS Code**.
  2. Open the `prism-validator` folder you created by selecting **File > Open Folder**.
  3. Open a **VS Code terminal** by clicking the **three-button menu** in the top-left corner of the VS Code window, then selecting **Terminal**.
  4. In the terminal, select **Command Prompt** by clicking the dropdown next to **PowerShell**.
  5. Run the following command to initialize the development environment:
     ```
     uv init
     ```
     This command will set up the necessary files like `pyproject.toml` and `python-environment`.

**Step 4: Configure** `pyproject.toml`
  
  The pyproject.toml file defines the dependencies and configurations for your Python project. You can edit it to specify the versions and libraries you need.
  1. Open the `pyproject.toml` file created during the `uv init` process.
  2. Replace its entire content with the following:
      ```
      [project]
      name = "prism-validator"
      version = "1.0.0"
      description = "A Streamlit application to validate PRISM configurations against generated reference files from TDTs."
      readme = "README.md"
      requires-python = ">=3.9"
      dependencies = [
          "streamlit",
          "pandas",
          "pyodbc",
          "openpyxl",
          "xlsxwriter",
          "matplotlib"
      ]
      ```
      
**Step 5: Set Up Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies**
  1. Install all the project dependencies from the `pyproject.toml` file by running the following command:
      ```
      uv sync
      ```
      This will install all the dependencies listed in the `pyproject.toml file` and set up a virtual environment (`.venv`), ensuring your project’s dependencies are isolated from your system Python.
     
  2. Run the following command to activate the environment:
      ```
      .venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
      
**Step 6: Create the Secrets File**

The application requires a `secrets.toml` file to store your database credentials.
1. Create a new folder named `.streamlit` inside the `prism-validator` directory.
2. Inside the .streamlit folder, create a new file named secrets.toml.
3. Add your database credentials to this file using the following format:

    ```
    [db]
    host = "YOUR_DATABASE_HOST"
    database = "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME"
    user = "YOUR_USERNAME"
    password = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
    ```

### 3. Running the Application
Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application with a single command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
Your web browser will automatically open a new tab with the running application.<br><br>


# 💻 How to Use the App

1.   **Connect to Database:** Fill in your database credentials in the sidebar (they will be pre-filled from your secrets file) and click **"Connect to Database"**.
2.   **Generate Reference Files:**
      * Click the **"Select TDT Folder"** button to open your computer's file browser and choose the folder containing your TDT Excel files.
      * Once the folder is selected, click **"Generate & Load Files"**. The app will process the files and show a success message.
3.   **Upload Statistics File:** Click "Browse files" to upload the `Consolidated Statistics file`.
4.   **Navigate to a Validation Tab:** Go to any of the validation tabs (e.g., "Metric Mapping Validation"). The "Run Validation" button will be enabled.
5.   **Run Validation:** Click the **"Run..."** button to perform the comparison. The results, including a summary and detailed tables, will appear on the screen.
6.   **Filter Results:** Use the dropdown menus to filter the detailed match and mismatch tables by TDT or Model.<br><br>

# 📦 Packaging the Application

To create a standalone executable for Windows, you can use PyInstaller. This allows you to share the application with users who do not have Python or the required dependencies installed.

### 1. Install PyInstaller
If you haven't already, install PyInstaller using pip:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 2. Run the Build Command
Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
pyinstaller --name "PRISM_Config_Validator" app.py
```
This command will create a `dist/PRISM_Config_Validator` folder containing the executable and all necessary files.

### 3. Running the Executable
1.  Navigate to the `dist/PRISM_Config_Validator` folder.
2.  Create a `secrets.toml` file in this folder with your database and API credentials (see "Create the Secrets File" section above for the format).
3.  Double-click the `PRISM_Config_Validator.exe` file to run the application.
```
